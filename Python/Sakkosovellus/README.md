Personal Project Overview

Here is my personal project, which focuses on saving data to a database and retrieving data from it. Each sports team has its own fine system. If someone is late for training, they will be penalized with a fine, and the collected money is used for the team's well-being. I created this app to manage those fines, making the process easier for users.

App Functionality

In this app, the user first needs to create players by going to the "Lisää Pelaaja" section. Once players have been added, the user can assign fines to each player. The "Lisää Sakkoja" action provides the user with a list of players who have been added to the app, after which they can enter information about the fine. If you want to see how much in fines a particular player has accumulated, you can use the "Hae Sakkoja" action and provide either the name or number of the player. When it's time for everyone to pay their fines, the user can click "Lähetä yksittäiset sakot" and select a player's name. This will send the fine list to that player via WhatsApp. If the user wants to see how much money has been collected and how much each player needs to pay, they can click "Kuukauden sakot." If, for any reason, the user needs to modify a fine, they can do so in the "Muokkaa Sakkoa" section. After fines have been paid, they can also be marked as paid in the "Sakko Maksettu" section. Feel free to ask if you need further assistance or more details!
